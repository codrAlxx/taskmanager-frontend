# Task Manager in React
A simple **task manager** web application written using the _MongoDB_, _Express_, _React_ and _Node.js_ stack. 
A project conceived as plain practice material, in order for me to improve my **web development** and **JavaScript** skills/general understanding.

## The Application

This app uses [**MongoDB Atlas**](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) as a _cloud database server_. You have to add your own `MONGODB_URL` environment variable inside the .env file so that the application can interface with the database.
The current version implements the following functions/interactions:

- **Add** a Task
- **Mark** as **Completed**
- **Edit** the Task
- **Delete** the Task
